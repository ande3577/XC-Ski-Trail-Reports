<b>Feb 3 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=98">Elm Creek Park Reserve</a> (Maple Grove):</b><br>
Conditions: Firm deck with a bit of ice and very fast. The classic track was icy which made for easy double poling even for an old fart like me.<br>Watch out for the deep gouges on the downhill section of the toilet bowl.  I hooked an edge on one and did a 180 before falling.<br>

<b>Feb 3 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=588">Green Acres Recreation</a> (Lake Elmo):</b><br>
Conditions: Relatively excellent.<br>Just spent an hour ski-skating at Green Acres. Snow is holding up.  One of those fast, yet stable days.  Cloud cover helps - none of that ice and slush mix today.   Enough sugar on top for good edge, balance and some sub-threshold V2 skating.  Rock skis not needed, just need to keep watch for a few thin spots and stay agile.  Thanks again to Green Acres (and Ben Popp) for salvaging the season.<br>

<b>Feb 2 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=98">Elm Creek Park Reserve</a> (Maple Grove):</b><br>
Conditions: Loose slush.<br>Had about an hour to ski, ran out to Elm Creek to get a quick workout. Mistake. Arrived around 4 p.m. Paved lot was full. Side lot was closed due to mud. Had to ride the shuttle. High School conference meet was beginning. I skied one lap, found 4-6" of slush. Slow. Felt bad for the kids. Realized it just wasn't meant to be for me today...<br>
(Stan Hokanson)

<li>
<b>Feb 2 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=97">Theodore Wirth Regional Park</a> (Minneapolis):</b><br>
Conditions: Fast dirty snow.<br>I skated the courses for both IPC races at 9am today and then some.  The trails were in great shape as the groomers had done a lot of work on them and I was one of the first ones on them.  Very dirty snow, would suggest B skiis.  Course was very fast too as it had frozen up again overnight.<br>
(Eve Stein)

<li>
<b>Feb 2 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=588">Green Acres Recreation</a> (Lake Elmo):</b><br>
Conditions: Brown.<br>The snow on most of the course is very dirty, and the ground is starting to show through in a couple of spots.  I wouldn't recommend using good skis until snowmaking can begin again -- I felt like I was skiing on sandpaper on the upper flat loop and on the downhill into the stadium.  The groomers have been doing a great job given the abysmal conditions, but there's not a lot to work with right now.<br>
(Emma Lee)

<li>
<b>Feb 2 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=588">Green Acres Recreation</a> (Lake Elmo):</b><br>
Conditions: Like a Caramel Macchiato Frappucino.<br>Semi-frozen tan slush, with a few pieces of ice and a some liquid mixed in. Slow, sticky, slushy, foggy, wet, blah. But....at least it was skiable; which is a plus considering the weather we've had.<br>
It was my first time to Green Acres, and I was impressed with the layout and effort they have clearly put in. Some nice hills, and decent variety.<br>
(Michael Schwartz)

<li>
<b>Feb 2 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=98">Elm Creek Park Reserve</a> (Maple Grove):</b><br>

Double-tracked from the high school races. Faster than expected.<br>
The Zetas worked according to Tom B....wish mine hadn't blown out a sidewall a few years ago.<br>

<b>Feb 1 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=418">Hiawatha Golf Course</a> (Minneapolis):</b><br>
Conditions: Island-Hopping awesome!<br>What a difference a day makes. Tuesday: ok crust skiing, Wednesday: only one small patch of snow left, barely connected. We could use a few inches... guess it's back to running.<br>
(Scott Hatch)

<li>
<b>Feb 1 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=97">Theodore Wirth Regional Park</a> (Minneapolis):</b><br>
Skate skiing at Wirth on Wednesday evening was surprisingly good.  The skate bed was not icing, it was easy to edge, and the uphills were not getting too cut up.  There are a few darker spots on the trail around the course, but those seem like they may be more from water seeping through the snowpack than from dirt starting to show.  Granted, I've only skied here in the evening lately, so bright light could prove me wrong.  Still, I'm impressed at how well the course is holding up.  Saw one high school group (Orono?) earlier, and what looked to be a master's group later, but generally not a lot of skier traffic (in the evening) all things considered.<br>
(Ted Lystig)

<li>
<b>Feb 1 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=97">Theodore Wirth Regional Park</a> (Minneapolis):</b><br>
Conditions: Weather really taking its toll...<br>I skied Tuesday night and it was wonderful.  Tonight (Wednesday) less so. There was a significant loss of quality today. I kicked both nights with Toko Red Klister. Tuesday was good, and it was great tonight in the few spots where the track was icy but very slow most everywhere else. I actually skied a loop tonight with my good skis and was nervous the whole time because of dirt and possible ground (too dark to tell), so I switched to rock skis to ease my mind. Track is deteriorating in many places but was still pretty decent considering this crazy winter. Overall: Better than not skiing and impressive considering, but it sure would be nice to just have a real winter.<br>
(Casey Rutherford)

<li>
<b>Feb 1 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=588">Green Acres Recreation</a> (Lake Elmo):</b><br>
Conditions: Excellent! Hard packed, fairly fast. Good skis for sure.<br>Skied 2 1/2 hours alternating between tough hill training and nice, easy, technique training on an incredibly wide and even top loop. Many of the trails have nice 4-8" base of man-made snow on them, almost all are open leading to some really great skiing. Only downside - incredibly crowded, always. Lots of high school teams training and racing, and seemingly the entire east metro on skis besides.<br>
(Rob Fanderson)

<li>
<b>Feb 1 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=108">Como Golf Course</a> (Saint Paul):</b><br>
Conditions: Better than expected!<br>Unlike the previous reporter, I found the Como glacier to be holding up very well. There are some icy spots, but overall it was better than expected if you don't mind being confined to a small area with good coverage. I classic skied with tape skis and they were fine if you don't mind the lack of set tracks. A double pole workout would be very doable.<br>
(Doug Schumacher)

<b>Feb 1 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=108">Como Golf Course</a> (Saint Paul):</b><br>

<b>Jan 31 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=97">Theodore Wirth Regional Park</a> (Minneapolis):</b><br>
I went classic skiing at Wirth on Tuesday evening at about 7:30.  The air temperature was still above freezing, and the snow was corn-like.  Tracks were set throughout most of the loop, with the exception of some of the steeper hills (up and down), a few merging sections, and near the lower start/finish area.  The start/finish area was a bit confusing, as there is very little light there, and what seem to be a few course options for the sit-ski racing.  Coverage was generally quite good, but there were two spots where I wasn't sure if the snow was thin or just dirty.  It actually seemed to ski faster out of the tracks than in, since a number of leaves were embedded in the classic tracks (and it almost felt like there might have been residual klister on the leaves as well).  No-wax skis gripped well out of the tracks, but were noisy as heck.  Not too crowded though - just one largish group finishing up around 8, and maybe a dozen of us beyond that.<br>

<b>Jan 28 - Medicine Lake (Plymouth):</b><br>
Conditions: Good.<br>Grooming report: Double classic tracks and a skate lane have been set around 2/3 of the shore of Medicine Lake starting in the lagoon just NW of the boat launch at French Park and running around the north bay, the entire west shore (minus the heavily trafficed area around the W boat launch), all bays and Peninsula on the SW side of the lake, and along the SE side of the lake as far as the art shanty's and the public beach.  Medicine lake is multiple use -- vehicles will inevitably wipe out small (hopefully) portions of the trail.  Classic tracks are deep and hard and should hold up well.  The skate lane improves skating in places, but crust cruising on the whole lake should be decent.  Be careful of a few thin spots where the classic tracks run on shore.<br>

<b>Jan 28 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=341">Woodland Trails</a> (Elk River):</b><br>
Conditions: Very good (98%); Thin (2%); Fun (100%).<br>Some of the most relaxing skiing I've had this year.  Generally great cover, albeit bumpy and grass showing through here and there. After a tentative first lap turned up only a few areas to be cautious about (described below), we were able to ski all of the downhills, twists, and turns with abandon. The places to watch out for are the parts of the trail system closer to the parking lot that have pavement/gravel underneath, especially the prairie loop and the last 1/4K of the 10K course when approaching the parking lot (walk or double pole in the grass).  Also, the very steep first half the 'Top of the World' climb was thin with several rocks (we walked up).  Other steeper hills were still OK, but will get thin with more use. The trail had only had about a dozen passes today, and there were only a couple cars in the lot when we left at 1:30PM.  My wife and I each had a small knick on one edge of one ski (prob from the uphills). I'd use B skis with care; and C skis with bravado.  Thanks to the grooming crew for once again making great skiing out of not much!<br>

Conditions: Remarkably not bad! Helps if you pretend it's mid-March.<br>Skated all of Cleary's trails this morning. There is no classic track, of course. After our 2"-3" last weekend they must've packed the small and middle loop, but not the outer loop. So while not perfect, those packed trails set up pretty hard, and the 1" or so we got yesterday makes for a pretty nice surface. Be aware of the usual trouble spots, and by all means use rock skis, and you can have a good time. Personally, I'd skip the cutoff to the outer loop - it's pretty rutted and there are a couple south facing areas that are burned out and totally un-skiable.<br>

<b>Jan 28 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=96">William O'Brien State Park</a> (Marine on St. Croix):</b><br>
Conditions: The fact that there will be a ski race this year at O'Brien is incredible given the lack of snow this year.  I skied this morning and conditions were good but thin.  Rock skis are a must.  Randy has been out grooming this morning and plans to groom again later today. It is hard to predict how the course will be tomorrow but Randy is an expert with low snow.  Be careful and avoid snowplowing on the hills.  Might not be the best race for a beginner. An additional inch tonight would be great.  Just keep in mind there is very little cushion in the event of a fall so extra caution is warranted. Having said the above the O'Brien event is always a great race and race director Everett puts on  a great event.<br>On another note the head groomer Randy is retiring after 22 years in the park.  A big reason why skiing has been so good is the hard work and dedication he has given to skiing.  This will be his last race and nobody is more disappointed at the lack of snow than he is.  If you see him thank him for all his hard work over the years - he will be missed.<br>

<b>Jan 26 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=98">Elm Creek Park Reserve</a> (Maple Grove):</b><br>
We skied Elm Creek Thursday night from 7:30-8:30, after temps had dropped back below freezing.  The best skating conditions were on the small donut loop near the lodge; the snow was cut up enough that you could get a decent edge.  On most of the rest of the snowmaking loop getting a consistent edge was difficult - I chose to double pole most of the course in the tracks, and just skate for the steeper uphills.  The classic tracks were bomber, but pretty well glazed.  The northern lights loop by evening was a mixed bag.  A few sections (namely those more to the north) were pretty decent, but several sections there were rock ski conditions at best.  In particular, the section right next to the road and joining the snow making loop was mostly bare ground.  For other sections, it certainly does raise your heart rate to note on a downhill that you're not seeing shadows in front of you, but dirt. <br>

The 4 inches of snow on Monday morning packed down nice and gave good cover.  It firmed up Tuesday night and received one more inch of snow that made for smooth skiing this morning.     <br>
The following areas need volunteers to put more snow on the course.  Under the pines by the campground, the tunnel, the RR tracks on either side of them on on them, the S-curve.  Volunteers who show photos of themselves and friend putting snow on these areas will receive a free stainless steel water bottle on race day at the registration table. Recommend "B skis" and skipping the Hardwood Hills Trail (gravel on the 1st steep climb). We'll skip this loop for the race unless more snow fall.  <br>

<b>Feb 3 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=37">Boulder Lake Management Area Ski Trails</a> (Duluth):</b><br>
We skated Bear Paw and Blue Ox at dusk, before the candlelight ski event. The trails still have good coverage, mostly. They were icy in spots, rutted in spots, and very nice in some spots. A couple of people had hiked on them, right down the middle of the skate lane. There was an intermittent skied-in track. <br>
We skated out onto Boulder Lake for awhile, too. It's a bit of a tough ski, a crust on top of soft stuff, some patches of ice blown clear by the wind. Hard to get an edge. Still fun, and very, very pretty.  Definitely better than not skiing.<br>

Got out ahead of the thaw and skijored up the closed section of Seven Bridges Road to the other barrier at Skyline Parkway.

As of this time there is no money in the trail account according to Parks and Trails staff at Moose Lake.

Conditions: Skiable, barely.<br>The trail at Chester was groomed after Friday's snow.  I skied it Sunday afternoon.  The loop on the north side nearest to the soccer field is pretty rough, there are a couple of mandatory dismounts.  The loop on the southern side nearest the down hill is actually skiable without too much damage to your skis.  There is one very thin snow section with ice under neath, and a few ares of debris turned up by the groomers tracks, but otherwise you can make a loop.  The ratio of ski tracks to walker tracks is about 1:20, so get out there!<br>

Conditions: Good.<br>Skated all trails today. Best conditions of the season (I do realize that is not saying much). Near "good skis" conditions and on most of the trail you could but the south-facing steep hills still have some dingers if not careful. All and all, really nice conditions out there- especially the '10k', which gets skied less. It amazing what nearly 2" of new snow will do.

The trail was rolled on Saturday after the few more inches of snow we received. We have about an inch of compacted base, with an undulating surface, with some grass and brush poking thru.

<b>Jan 28 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=37">Boulder Lake Management Area Ski Trails</a> (Duluth):</b><br>
Conditions: Nice.<br>Boulder has not been groomed since the most recent snowfall, so there are a couple of inches of fluffy snow on top of a thin, firm base. I had a great time skating it today. Blue Ox and Bear Paw had better coverage than Nine Pine, but Nine Pine was quite skiable, with just a few thin spots under the pines. A pal who was kicking said Lonesome Grouse was good, with a skied-in track. There's a rough skied-in track throughout the system. I talked to some striders who were happy with it and some who weren't. Overall, coverage is surprisingly good -- the kind of thing you'd be delighted with if it were November.<br>

Conditions: Poor-fair.<br>No grooming has taken place recently. That said, it was packed down in places from recent skiers and it was worth the trip albeit on my rock skis. The thinnest spots were under the pines toward the bottom of the river, nearest the lower parking lot. Don't get discouraged if you start there, as it gets better the higher you climb.<br>

<b>Jan 28 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=35">Snowflake Nordic Ski Center</a> (Duluth):</b><br>
Conditions: Good! Snowflake did a good job considering the lack of snow we've seen this year.<br>After a couple of inches of snow yesterday, I was chomping at the bit to get out my first time this year.  I was pleasantly surprised with the conditions at Snowflake.  Freshly groomed last night.  Always worth the $7 as they continue to lead the way in keeping their trails at top shape compared to anywhere in the Duluth area.  I skied about 14k total on the classic trails.  There are definitely some bare spots (under trees, etc) but very nice overall.  I finally got my hands on a pair of "B" skis, and I don't recall scraping any rocks as I avoided some of the thin sections of trail.  I wouldn't consider using my "A" skis quite yet until we get more snow.   Also, plenty of people skating, trails seemed well covered for that too.<br>

<b>Jan 27 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=39">Lester Park</a> (Duluth):</b><br>
Conditions: Couple inches of snow.<br>We skied in a track this afternoon as the snow was ending. It was ju-u-u-st skiable, and by the time we got back to the lower loops, hikers had already done quite a bit of damage. There's so little snow that each footprint exposes dirt. The upper loops were in much better shape. If you go, watch out for a new culvert at the bottom of the first hill after G. If you stay way to the right you can get across.<br>

But it was skatable, B skis recommended.  No rocks, just twigs.  Upper portions of the trail had much more snow and fewer twigs.  Still quite of few dipsy doodles but quite enjoyable.  <br>Skate skied from Britain Peak over the Hogback loop to the Picnic loop and back along the ski thru.  Best was Hogback and Picnic loop, worst was bottom part of the Oberg loop, and the ski back to Britain Peak on the lower ski through.  I should have done the Homestead loop (higher to get the better snow)  Be careful of the ski grapping twigs and dipsy doodles on the downhills.  One really bad one between the high points on the picnic loop, a real brain rattler.<br>

Conditions: Cloudy 34 degrees. "B" Skis.<br>Last week's snow covered the trails pretty good and the groomer was able to get out and pack and track. There are some thin spots, and I'm not ready to take the good skis out just yet. However you should do no new damage to your "B" skis. Classic track is deeper than I would expect with such thin snow.

Wynne Creek, Laurentian, Oslo and Biwabik Spur were just opened this week and need a little work, so beware of some twigs and occasional rock.  The Cedar, Gold, Silver and Bronze trail are all great- bring your good skis!  No grooming today unfortunately, so conditions were soft with the recent fresh snow.  All trails scheduled for grooming tomorrow.  All the snow clinging to the evergreens makes for beautiful skiing right now!<br>

One could use good skis with care on the first, lower, loop of the Pine Trail but I used rock skis and suggest that for the upper loop especially. All sections are fully snow-covered.<br>

Race; 5K course to be groomed later tonight; balance of trail system groomed Friday night has light dusting of snow fluff from Sunday; ski conditions rated as very good for entire system.<br>I got out this morning to begin grooming for tomorrows Classic Race and found the new snow from this past weekend rolling right along. Then about noon the sun peeked out and the temp went up just enough to get that sticky action going. I pulled off the trails after completing the 3.5K course and will continue grooming later tonight. I did make one loop around the 5K course and found the whole course in very good ski condition with the exception of that south exposed Pine Hill climb. You can ski up it but it is definitely our thinnest area.  Looking forward to seeing everyone tomorrow.<br>

Conditions: Excellent, considering the sparse snow cover.<br>Skied the 10K loop at Rainbow Resort Sunday with two friends, one a skater, and myself and another classic skiers.  Very nice 10 "outside" loop, lots of hills, some rolling, some quite steep for a nice little speed-rush.  All in all, the skiing was fantastic! and the brother/sister team on duty that day were very friendly.  If you ski at Rainbow, make sure to have a burger-basket in the restaurant afterward, they were superb!<br>

Conditions: Excellent, real snow!<br>I made the trip from Minneapolis to Maplelag via Ottertail to find cold (-10 F) conditions, but the trails were in incredible shape.  I did not miss the man-made snow I have been skiing on all year.  Yes, Maplelag a long car ride, yes you are busy.  But it is well worth the trip!  The trails are wonderfully cared for and conditions are excellent.  Make the trip, you won't be sorry.<br>

Conditions: Very good to excellent. Packed powder. Morning low of -10 climbing to mid teens, sunshine and light winds during the day. All 64km of trail open, tracks set on 56km of trail, 15km groomed for skate. Light snow falling Sunday evening.<br>Even though we don't have a huge base of snow, the skiing is mid winter with all trails open. Just a few minor thin/rough areas. We reset 150km of tracks Fri through Sun and the skate decks are mostly firm and fast. Good to see the classic trails skied hard this weekend and people enjoying the double track. The groomers are ready to go back out in the morning and groom the fresh snow falling tonight.<br>

Conditions: Soft, but otherwise excellent.<br>It was our first time skiing on natural snow this winter, and our first time at Rainbow.  What a relief to find that our ski season was not going to be a complete dive this year!  After almost four inches of new snow on Friday (which was groomed) and an additional inch last night, coverage was excellent.  We did both classic and skate. Wonderful trail system, especially the hills on the 10k loop. More skiers should check it out.<br>

I have groomed not quite  of the trail system so far.   I will go back out to finish this evening.  23K will be groomed for classic skiing and 20K combed for skate skiing.   Cooler night temps should help set things of nicely.<br>

Conditions: Very good to excellent. Marsh crossings improved with new snow.<br>Snow falling this morning with a solid 2-3&#8243; of dense moisture laden quick hitting snow as of 11am and light snow still falling. All the classic trails tracked for a total of 56km groomed with tracks. We groomed the skate lanes as well, putting the entire trail system groomed this morning. The new snow is making for fantastic conditions with the existing base/snow we had. We  have around 54km of tracks set for classic and 15km open for skating. 4km of snowshoe trails open.<br>
Grooming plans: We will polish trails rest of day and back out in the early morning to refresh where needed.<br>

<b>Jan 26 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=7">Maplelag Resort</a> (Callaway):</b><br>
Conditions: Good to excellent. Scattered thin spots and a few rough areas on marsh crossings but overall very nice skiing. All 64km open. Tracks set on 32km of trail. 15km combed for skating and remaining km packed with skier made track. Track set on side of North Loup now as well as skate deck on side. Best conditions of the year.<br>After a incredible frosty day and some amazing skate skiing on the skate trails, we finally cleared off last night and the trails tightened up. Warmer temps today loosened the snow again but held out just fine with 34 degrees as the high mark. We set track late this afternoon at transition time on Lucky's and Mother North Star and both those trails groomed out nicely all the way through. We also built up the southern exposed hills on the classic race course for sections and cleared snow off the basketball court and moved to start/finish area.<br>
Grooming plans: We will touch up the edges on the skate trails in the morning and set tracks on all remaining classic trails not already tracked. We are hoping to have 54km of tracks by the weekend.<br>

Conditions: Classic tracks setting up well, not perfect all over, but very skiable on the many trails we skied yesterday. I just had to go on Skaters to check it out for a little ways: base solid, deck very smooth with silky fast texture even with short poles, long skis and kick wax.<br>My skiing partner for the afternoon had never skied at Maplelag before, has a limited skiing backround.  He used his fish scales with 3 pin system. Had nothing but a super time skiing on the trails that matched his comfort zone. Many positive comments and remarks to go back soon and play in the snow!<br>

The trees are frosty & beautiful making it very scenic to be out grooming. Even though we have had to lift the track setters a few times for a short distance, it was nice to be able to lay in some tracks on a majority of our system. About half the trail system is finished and upon completing grooming today we will update conditions once again. Stay tuned and think snow.<br>

Trail was rolled earlier this morning with as good results as can be expected in this season where the snow has been a no-show. Kudos to the groomers for their work. There are spots with grass, sticks, and some dirt here and there. Use your rock skis. The snow is deepest where there is less tree cover: Rudy's, Big Ben, and Potlatch were better than North Star or Plantation. That said, we had a great time at the Arboretum. The snow was fast and sweet. A day of skiing with a little snow is better than a day with no skiing.<br>

Conditions: Extremely solid.<br>Skied the north half this morning. The corduroy was still present from the last grooming and it would occasionally send a ski on its own path, but it wasn't icy. The sun came out at 10:30 and started loosening it up. By noon it was getting pretty sticky in the sun.  The grooming crew was working on covering thin spots early today.

Conditions: klister and fast, no bare patches so far.<br>I skied OO with the Hayward Middle School kids Thursday evening. Klister and transformed snow. Still enough edging to make good skating and striding. I think our tracks will survive the big thaw this week. If you are skiing Birkie country this weekend look for icy in the am and more controlled skiing mid morning through the day. Still on race skis.<br>

Conditions: Conditions in the morning were amazing. Perfect trails freshly groomed, temps in the high 20s, clear skies, no wind, very few skiers.<br>We skied a bunch of different trails near Telemark the last three days. There was an inch of fresh snow Sunday night.  Today we covered parts of the World Cup loop, the power lines, much of the Korte, parts of the Birkie trail.  Almost all of it was fresh corduroy and set up very nicely.  We were off the trails by noon when it was still below freezing, but the sky was clear and it was well above freezing by 1:00.  Cross your fingers and hope these excursions above 32F are short.<br>

On the steep downhills I was lucky I didn't pitch head over heels in between the shady to sunny spots. The snow cover is very good, although I did see a few bare spots.

Conditions: Very good to excellent.<br>Classic skied this morning from OO south to Mosquito Brook. The right side (southbound) tracks are firm but groomed before the 3 inch Friday snow. Powdery, rough skied in edges, decent for grip, slower but with great control. The left side tracks (southbound) were obviously groomed after the Friday snow. Firm, slick and much faster. Overall the best skiing of the year for anyone living around the Twin Cities. Pic showing the unplugged boys posse headed south in the right (southbound) tracks.<br>

<b>Jan 29 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=132">Birkie Trail</a> (Hayward):</b><br>
Conditions: Very good.<br>We skate skied today starting from Fish Hatchery.  The trails there were in very good shape, with much less use than on the Birkie trail.  The Birkie trail had seen a bit more use, but was a bit more firmly packed and still in great shape.  We also tried the trail system just off the Birkie trail near the Mosquito Brook feed area.  Those trails were also in good condition.  A bit narrower, but still packed well (for both skate and classic), and with some nice flow.  Apart from the classic tracks on the east side of the Birkie trail (which had been set before the most recent snowfall), the skate and classic tracks in all three sections had been set after the last snow.  A great day for skiing on all of these trails.<br>

<b>Jan 28 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=126">Telemark Resort Trails</a> (Cable):</b><br>
Conditions: Telemark's main trail (The Birkie Loop) is double classic tracked and the skating is beautiful.  Other trails like Kortie 17Km to finish, Tony Wise, World Cup, etc. were not groomed or rolled only (soft and deep!).  Note:  North End and Birkie trails appear to have caught up with the seemingly continuous snow and the skiing seemed perfect today.<br>Lots of international skiers (notably Russians and Germans) out on the trails after the big World Cup events from earlier in the day.  It was the definition of inspiration watching the special XC athletes at the biathlon range.<br>

<b>Jan 28 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=132">Birkie Trail</a> (Hayward):</b><br>
Conditions: Great coverage; best for skate.<br>We skied classic today on the Classic Birkie trail from the powerlines all the way down to Fish Hatchery.  A single track was set down to OO; tracks were set either side once on the main Birkie trail from OO south.  North of OO, it seemed like the tracks were likely set before the recent 2-3 inch snowfall; same for the tracks on the right going south from OO.  The conditions for striding were often better in the skate lane (freshly groomed, nice and firm) than in the tracks.  Lots of people out enjoying the snow today, so skiing south in the left hand tracks wasn't a very viable proposition.  Skating would generally be a better call, as the skate lane was in top notch shape.<br>

I started skating around 8:45am from Telemark.  Went out World Red trail to the powerlines.  The powerlines had about an inch of cold slow snow on top of corduroy.  When the powerlines ended, I was able to experience what the elite Birkie skiers do with Virgin firm corduroy until the three Norwegian coaches flew past me crested the hill and vanished from sight.  When I got to the Kortie classic fork where it goes left and the Kortie goes right it was still ungroomed to the right with about 5 inches of snow on it for about a half of a K or so.  The remainder was groomed very well!<br>

Conditions: Very good, if a bit on the soft side.  Classic track was filled in with an inch of new snow from this morning.<br>Skated north from Double O to the 9K mark and back on the Birkie trail.  Skate lane was narrower than usual due to a ridge of snow a couple feet to the outside of the classic track.  Things had not firmed up much from the snowfall of Sunday night and Monday, and the inch that fell this morning didn't help much either.  But, other than being on the soft-slow side, conditions are very good.<br>

Conditions: Good to very good!<br>Dave W. had been out after yesterday's mini snow squall, which left around 2 inches. That lead to the best conditions of the season. I classic skied with race skis. There are thin spots, but they are avoidable. The best was along Anchor, Sugarbrush, and Seagull. Deer Path and some of the other classic only trails were good to the west, but on the east the thin spots were more frequent. It would be best to not use your race skis there. The Ashwabay skate trails looked perfect and level. Jolly trails did get groomed for both skate and classic, but I didn't not check them out today. That's for tomorrow.<br>

Rocket fast skating and& striding this morning with cloudy skies & temps in the low 30s.

Purple has two bare spots with low snow, probably the only trail I'd avoid. Green/campground is good, blue also has good coverage. Yellow/orange were in good condition as well. Unfortunately, the trails are still open to hiking so there are footprints on the trails but if you're dying to ski, get out there and do it!<br>

<b>Jan 28 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=348">Troll Hollow</a> (Dresser):</b><br>
Conditions: Excellent for both classic and skate.<br>Sorry about the condition of the tracks Friday.  The morning groomer was inexperienced, and Trollhaugen is trying to make sure it doesn't happen again.  I have taken over for Rollie, but honestly, the tracks have been set very nicely whenever I've skied this winter, and today was no exception.<br>
(Rollie, I know you're still monitoring, but don't fret.  Your "Baby" might have been a bit colicky yesterday, but it's fine today.  Enjoy your retirement!)<br>
Schedule update:<br>
Monday-JV race at 4:00.  Done about 5:00.<br>
Tuesday-Conference meet starting at 10:00.  Done about 3:00.<br>
Wednesday-Conference meet at 10:00.  Done about 4:30.<br>
Thursday-JV meet at 6:00.  Done about 7:00.<br>
Tracks will be reset after the meets Tuesday and Wednesday.<br>

<b>Jan 27 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=348">Troll Hollow</a> (Dresser):</b><br>
Conditions: Fresh grooming but worst classic tracks ever, skate was fine.<br>Was the first person on the course this morning and thought, awesome fresh tracks, but was thoroughly disappointed instead. Could not keep my skis in the track on ANY corners because the corners were too sharp, sometimes the track was so close to the edge of the snow pack my outside pole would drop away from me. The skate lane had been groomed right over the track in numerous places.  The tracks were not consistent and in some places weren't tracked continuously. Overall very poor conditions for classic, was a waste of my money. The skate lane was freshly groomed and fast.<br>

Remember no dogs or snowshoes even if fluffy is a well trained dog or you stay to the side with snowshoes. As groomers we need the snow from tree to tree on the trail surface.

Conditions: Fresh grooming on 7" new snow.  32 degrees.<br>Afterglow's trails are as advertised by the resort and as endorsed by others, wonderful. I had enough time to ski a variety of easy and more difficult trails. The Blue labelled trails I skied seemed to fall into the easier side of the Blue designation. At 32 degrees, everyone on classic skis was taking a best guess since there was no consensus. After a long drive to get there, and being somewhat road weary, I thought I had the right wax applied and wound up with only Toko binder for kick wax. It worked.<br>
The trails are beautiful the north woods you would expect and everything was flocked with the new snow. The classic track is cut out wide from the edge providing a generous poling lane. I left plenty to explore and as such, a reason to return.<br>

Expect firm conditions in the morning, softening through the day. Downhills will be fast, and turns at the bottoms will be scraped to ice by the second lap. <br>
Note - course change for 43 km. Leo's Loop is out. Instead, there will be three laps around the final 7 km - my favorite part of the course. Have fun tomorrow!<br>

<b>Feb 1 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=358">Iola Winter Sports Club Trails</a> (Iola):</b><br>
Conditions: Boilerplate.<br>We tried skiing Wednesday night, should have listened to Phils message about going biking instead, did one green loop and abandoned our efforts, wishing for skis with metal edges.  The base is very thin and not much to work with. There were a few people out taking advantage of shallow tracks to do some double poling but in the dark the occasional bare spot was interesting to say the least.  We talked with Phil and he said until this warm spell is over he doesn't have plans to groom. Looks as if we will continue to allocate our ski budget to travel instead of new equipment.<br>

Not groomed but skiable. Looks like there were plenty of people who enjoyed the trail over the weekend since under the fluff I could see the indentations of poles, dogs, and snowshoers!

Conditions: 1-2" hard packed base with ice underneath.  Some thin spots here and there.  Very little debris, but a rock here and there.<br>Very nice day at Greenbush.  The woods help break the wind.  Best trails were purple-green-purple (very good), brown (excellent) and the SW purple up to the overlook (very good).  The south marsh area was rough in spots.  Still recommend rock or B skis.<br>

<b>Jan 28 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=362">Greenbush Ski Trails</a> (Greenbush):</b><br>
Conditions: Very Good, considering what the groomers had to work with.<br>I give those who groomed these trails an A+.  I skied with older skis but could have used my newer racing skis.  The light snow that came last night along with a solid base made skiing enjoyable.  There were spots where the coverage was thin, but the groomers did such a good job by not only preserving the trail base but providing room to ski around these spots.  The bottom line is I had a good time.<br>

Excellent skiing at Greenbush this afternoon. The 3/4 inch of wet snow adhered to the existing base to make for some great skiing. Even striders were having a good ski in skied in tracks. Stick to the purple to green to green cutoff back to the purple for the best skiing. Brown trail is also very good.<br>

Conditions: Fair to good.<br>Skied all wooded trails. Classic track solid but about half icy with a few bare spots. Classic outside the tracks was fine. Skating would probably be pretty darn good as overall coverage is good. I would ski it when above freezing or it might be too icy/rutted/dicey. Watch for the 2 small spots of exposed gravel on the John Minix Trails downhill from the swimming pool parking lot. Campground area had the best coverage (100%) and best tracks.

Conditions: Excellent.<br>Park has set a deep and firm classical track that is the best Ive seen anywhere all year.  And Friday night's half inch of powder has collected in the tracks yielding beautiful hard wax conditions. A note of warning: Whoever did the grooming set the tracks down some of the steeper hills.

Note: Now that they have set tracks, the trails are classic only again.<br>

Icy, several bare spots in the classic track. The few areas with some fresh snow in the track were fun, though. Skate lane looked fairly icy and bumpy. Some might call these conditions poor, but it beats walking.<br>

Conditions: Good, tracked!<br>Finally, groomed tracks. Super fast after last night's dusting. Downhills near the bike trail are hairy as tracks laid most/all of the way down/up the 3 descents but enough snow fell to get grip with one ski out of the track.

Conditions: Good to excellent.<br>Just got back from Lake K and was high impressed considering the warm temps recently. The system was groomed last night and they did an outstanding job which left a very firm corduroy base. The half inch of new snow received on Friday night also made for excellent skiing, just enough to help keep a stable ski. There were some icy spots in places but you should be able to manage these sections from seeing other skiers tracks. Classic lanes looked good too. "B" skis if you have them just in case.<br>

<b>Jan 26 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=610">Maple Bluff Country Club</a> (Maple Bluff):</b><br>
Conditions: Good classic, fair skate.<br>Classic track mostly deep and firm, but very icy. Skate lane rolled well and firm, but damaged. Some bonehead skated the trail when soft, and left ruts. They also sign and pack a walking trail, and most walkers are pretty good about going there, but it only takes one on a warm day to posthole the skate lane. From the depth of the prints, it looks like a gorilla took the Hound of the Baskervilles for a walk. Still pretty good skiing, however. Thanks for the grooming!<br>

There were bare spots, slush puddles and bits of ice here and there, but I was able to skate without taking my skis off.  I was able to maneuver around the bare spots.  Wasn't fast, but I had decent glide for 40 degrees, and I even skied in my bike shorts. The longer loops are not worth trying until more snow arrives.<br>

Conditions: Fair to good on lower loops, good to very good on upper loops.<br>Skated both lower and upper loops this morning. Things were better than I expected.  Nearly all of the upper loops were in very good shape with decent snow cover and no ice. Some lower loop areas are a bit iffy but you can ski around them without too much trouble. The final hill of "two tier" is probably the worst. <br>

<b>Jan 29 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=377">Nordic Ski Trail</a> (La Grange):</b><br>

Conditions: Parts really good, parts not so much. Crusty throughout.<br>Skied this late afternoon on the lower loops and upper field sections.  Crusty but skiable for the most part but there are some thin sections, especially the bridges.  You can catch a decent edge where the groomer tilled the top layer but the hilly sections were treacherous. Good double-pole workout conditions but not great skiing.  Fortunately good grooming this past week preserved the trail through the difficult weather.<br>

<b>Jan 26 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=370">Lapham Peak</a> (Delafield):</b><br>
Conditions: Slow but full coverage.<br>Skated Thursday night around 8 for 1 hour. 34 degrees at the Delafield exit ramp and 42 degrees at the parking lot, weird.  Very slow and I felt like I was fighting my skis the whole way. I'm not sure if any wax recipe would have helped, everyone looked slow. Good workout and at least we have something.<br>
(Danny Crawford)

<li>
<b>Jan 26 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=377">Nordic Ski Trail</a> (La Grange):</b><br>
Conditions: 1-2 inch base, slowly deteriorating due to upper 30's.<br>I skied from 3:30 to 5:30, and with the warmer temps it was soft and sticky in areas.  Got a bit better when the temp dropped a few degrees.  I saw more bare spots, although they are easily maneuverable, the up hills are getting thin, but ok overall. <br>

The conditions are fine.  There is 100% coverage throughout with literally a couple rocks to watch for.  A hard/icy base is holding nicely and some areas have a nice fluff/broken icy layer on top of it.  <br>

<b>Jan 25 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=466">Fox Hill Nordic</a> (West Bend):</b><br>

There are still some very thin spots that are icy. Most are easily avoided except for the twisting downhill coming back to the parking lot from the wooded section.  This is most safely skied uphill.<br>

<b>Jan 25 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=377">Nordic Ski Trail</a> (La Grange):</b><br>
Conditions: Firm, slick/icy.<br>Skied this afternoon and conditions were OK, but was a bit slick from the rain on Sunday that froze.  About 75% of trail decent and I was able to get an edge, but the downhills were pretty sketchy, washed out, so use caution.  Also a bit thin on the steeper ups, but I was happy to get a good ski in.  Another grooming to churn up the ice or another few inches of snow would be great, but it is what it is.<br>

Conditions: Perfect. Sunny 14 degrees. Star Green for kick.<br>Last night's 3 inches of fluffy snow was all groomed in by the time I arrived this morning. Piston Bully perfection throughout the entire trail system. Classic skied it all and then went out and skated the novice loop. (Thanks for naming a trail after my skating abilities!) Loved the Powderhorn loop and the jacket flapping downhills on Cliffhanger. Met a lot of nice skiers today and almost all were from Minnesota. (Strange don't they have snow there?) Even met a couple of high school skiers from section 7!(Daughters section) Fantastic trail system, keep up the great work.<br>

Conditions: New Snow.<br>Although a bit chilly with the wind, it was another great day skiing at ABR. It snowed about 2-3 inches Friday night and snowed another 2 while we were skiing. We classic skied 30k's and the new snow was very welcome, especially on Peltonen Passout trail giving us much welcome control on the downhills. As usual, the grooming was excellent and the trails were beautiful with all the new fallen snow.<br>

Nice to pull in and be greeted by a friendly face telling you all 66K have been freshly groomed and are ready to go.

If like me you are drawn to the area by the other "big" name trail systems, don't overlook the quiet gem. Had the honor of meeting the owners/trail groomers at the warming house. Got the history on the humble beginnings of this trail system and the plans for future expansion. A very mild donation only trail so be sure to bring the whole family out for this one. Had the entire trail system to myself as I skied it one and half times. A perfect afternoon ski made even better by the light snow that started to fall. Ski Miljes!<br>

<b>Feb 1 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=154">Swedetown Trails</a> (Calumet):</b><br>
Conditions: I took a guess that the higher elevation at Swedetown might have better conditions than what I'd seen earlier at Chassell and MTU, which were both icy in the track. Swedetown was excellent, considering how warm it has been. It was 33 degrees with light drizzle.<br>Due to lack of use, the skate deck was still plenty fluffy when I headed out at 3:00 pm, and the classic track was also very good. The track had been set some time ago. The tree snow had fallen into it here and there, something a regular skier at Swedetown is used to. <br>
I took the good no wax classic skis all the way out to the end of the Bear Chase trails following a one lap warm up on Pines. I have not been out the Bear trails for a long time and I wanted something not fast. It was somewhat slow going. The farther out I got on the Bear loops, the better the track got for an easy kick. The downhills were easy out of track with the fluffy skate deck.<br>
Back at the car I messed around with kick wax until I got it right and headed out Powderhouse after a warmup on Len's. The waxable skis ran considerably faster than the no waxers and they climbed better in the track. Powderhouse is a blast and you can skip the two tough entry hills, Jekyll and Hyde, by starting on the Pines. Due to oveall lack of snow time on groomed trails, I skipped J and H. They are a thrill ride when you're ready for it.<br>
It was good to start with the easy stuff and then take just enough of the rock-em-sock-em on Powderhouse to finish up about three hours of skiing. It was better than expected, good job groomers.<br>

Conditions: Fair.<br>I skied Rock Cut this morning about 10:30 and found it better than I expected. From the Rt 173 entrance I went in the connector loop to the Vasa loop. (Is it now called the Wayne Fish loop?) The whole loop is skiable if you are comfortable skiing on hardpark with a thin layer of soft snow on top. There are short bare spots under the pines where the connector loop connects, and crossing the ditch on the connector trail.  The rest is fair to good.  Even the tollway hill was pretty good. The sun will do some damage this afternoon but I think it will still be skiable tomorrow morning.  Rock skis recommended. Happy skiun.<br>

<b>Feb 2 - Methow Valley (Winthrop, WA):</b><br>
Conditions: Hard packed, corduroy, groomed and tracked daily.<br>Spent last 4 days skiing these trails.  The reputation of the Methow lived up to my expectations - the grooming was exceptional and every trail provided beautiful views of the Cascades against blue sky.  Cozy little cabins to rent at reasonable prices.  We brought our dog and found several dog friendly trails.<br>

<b>Jan 31 - Icicle River Trail (Leavenworth, WA):</b><br>
Conditions: Fantastic conditions this morning!  Freshly groomed old snow--but the glide was great in both the skate lane and track.  Sunny and clear.<br>This was our best ski of the 2011-12 season.  Great flow to this 8k trail and the mountain scenery is hard to beat.  Made 3 loops and then broke for lunch.  Sweet!<br>

<b>Jan 29 - Methow Valley (Winthrop, WA):</b><br>
Conditions: 36F with icy trail conditions in the valley.  Track was superb for double poling.  Skate lane was hard in most places but difficult to get an edge during our morning ski.  Hoping for the trails to soften a wee bit during the afternoon.<br>Cross country skiing is "king" in this valley.  Over 200k of groomed trails.  There is plenty of snow here for snow-starved Midwesterners.  <br>

<b>Jan 27 - Alturas Lake (Stanley, ID):</b><br>
Conditions: Perfect snow though grooming was in progress.  Single track was coming.  We had rolled now.  Outstanding scenery surrounding 3 foot plus snow pack.<br>Alturas Lake is a series of trails near an alpine lake 32 miles north west of Sun Valley.  Narrow trails were a nice change from wider trails elsewhere in the area.  Wonderful trip to remind us what good snow is like.<br>
